Tutorial
========

Write requests in file with ``*.http`` extension and run a request
under a cursor with ``:VialHttp`` command (``<leader><cr>`` mapping by
default).

Basic syntax::

    # comment string

    Some-Header: value

    METHOD /some/url [query_param=value] [form_param:=value] [file_param@=/path/to/file] \
                     [Header:value] [< /path/to/body] [| template1,template2] [<< HEREDOC]

    TEMPLATE name [<< HEREDOC]
    Header: ${json['field']}
    Header: ${headers['header']}
    Cookie: cookie=${cookies['cookie']}
    ${set_cookies()}

GET requests
------------

GET request::

    GET https://vial-http.appspot.com    # Comments can be on a request line too.

Response::

    {
      "result": "Hello"
    }

You can define default host and headers::

    Host: https://vial-http.appspot.com
    Accept-Language: en
    Cookie: foo=bar

    GET /headers

Response::

    {
      "cookies": {
        "foo": "bar"
      },
      "headers": {
        "Accept-Encoding": "identity",
        "Accept-Language": "en",
        "Cookie": "foo=bar",
        "Host": "vial-http.appspot.com",
        "User-Agent": "vial-http
      }
    }


Simple, huh? Header value will be in effect for all requests on any line after.

In a response window status line you can see a response code and
connect/read times. For example ``Response: 200 OK 42ms 10ms``.

**NOTE:** if you use a status line plugin like lightline or airline, you will
not see the response text in the status line. However, you can use
``VialHttpResponse()`` to get the response or configure your plugin to show it.

You can pass query params as usual::

    GET /query?q=some%3Astring+with+spaces&page=1

But there is a special syntax. ``=`` defines query string params with proper
uri encoding::

    GET /query q="some:string with spaces" page=1

It uses shell-like rules to detect request parts.
For example space escape with backslash::

    GET /query q=some:string\ with\ spaces page=1

``:`` is used to define request specific headers::

    GET /query q=query User-Agent:evil-bot

Response::

    {
      "headers": {
        "Accept-Encoding": "identity",
        "Accept-Language": "en",
        "Cookie": "foo=bar",
        "Host": "vial-http.appspot.com",
        "User-Agent": "evil-bot
      },
      "page": 1,
      "result": "query"
    }


POST data
---------

You can attach request body by inserting content after request line::

    POST /body
    some body
    for request

Response::

    {
      "result": "some body\nfor request"
    }

Vial-Http gets body from a continuous block of text without empty lines after request line.
If you need to deal with empty strings you can use heredoc::

    POST /body << HERE

    some

    body
    HERE

Response::

    {
      "result": "\nsome\n\nbody"
    }

Also you can use a file content as a body::

    POST /body < /tmp/some.data


POST form
---------

Forms are passed as url-encoded body with ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``
content type::

    POST /form Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    p1=boo&p2=10

Response::

    {
      "p1": "boo",
      "p2": 10
    }

But it looks ugly and Vial-Http has special syntax via ``:=`` operator::

    POST /form p1:=boo p2:=10


POST JSON
---------

Vial-Http detects json content automatically and sets proper Content-Type::

    POST /json
    {
        "p1": "boo",
        "p2": "10"
    }

Response::

    {
      "p1": "boo",
      "p2": 10
    }


POST multipart form
-------------------

You need to set proper content type::

    POST /multipart p1:=boo p2:=10 Content-Type:multipart/form-data

Raw request::

    POST /multipart HTTP/1.1
    Host: vial-http.appspot.com
    Accept-Encoding: identity
    User-Agent: vial-http
    Content-Length: 203
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=qAJxpKjDkp45PkAaahA1ZY1bUULutI

    --qAJxpKjDkp45PkAaahA1ZY1bUULutI
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="p1"

    boo
    --qAJxpKjDkp45PkAaahA1ZY1bUULutI
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="p2"

    10
    --qAJxpKjDkp45PkAaahA1ZY1bUULutI--

Or to use ``@=`` operator to attach a file field::

    POST /multipart p1:=boo p2:=10 file@=/tmp/some.data

Raw request::

    POST /multipart HTTP/1.1
    Host: vial-http.appspot.com
    Accept-Encoding: identity
    User-Agent: vial-http
    Content-Length: 358
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=dsW9yj9Tihf5S188PgmgrKpJc5KE4G

    --dsW9yj9Tihf5S188PgmgrKpJc5KE4G
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="p1"

    boo
    --dsW9yj9Tihf5S188PgmgrKpJc5KE4G
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="p2"

    10
    --dsW9yj9Tihf5S188PgmgrKpJc5KE4G
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="some.data"
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream

    some
    data

    --dsW9yj9Tihf5S188PgmgrKpJc5KE4G--


Basic authorization
-------------------

There is a ``:VialHttpBasicAuth`` command to make an ``Authorization``
HTTP basic auth header::

    :VialHttpBasicAuth [username]

It will output proper header you can use::

    Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz

    GET /auth/basic

Response::

    {
      "password": "pass",
      "user": "user"
    }


Sensitive data/parametric requests
----------------------------------

You may want to use the same request with different data
or do not want to keep sensitive data in a file. Vial-Http
provides ``__input__`` and ``__pwd__`` placeholders for that::

    POST /auth/email email:=__input__ password:=__pwd__

Now you can input email and password in native vim inputs.


Handle state via templates
--------------------------

It's a common case to use data from a previous response, some headers, cookies
or json fields. Vial-Http provides templates for that::

    TEMPLATE cookies
    ${set_cookies()}

    POST /auth/email email:=boo password:=foo | cookies # templates are specified after pipe

Following line will be generated after this POST::

    Cookie: auth=boo:foo

You can execute::

    GET /whoami

And get authorized response::

    {
      "user": "boo"
    }

You can use these expression in ``${}``:

* ``json["field"]["subfield"]`` access to json body
* ``headers["header"]`` access to headers
* ``cookies["cookie"]`` access to cookies with proper quoting
* ``rcookies["cookie"]`` access to cookies without quoting
* ``set_cookie()`` outputs whole Cookie header with all cookies
* ``set_cookie('cookie1', 'cookie2')`` outputs Cookie header with particular cookies

Also you can use templates to generate other requests::

    TEMPLATE order << HERE # multiline template with empty lines needs heredoc
    GET /order/status id=${json['id']}

    DELETE /order id=${json['id']}
    HERE

    POST /order | order

Response::

    {
      "id": "dcf43d11-14b4-4737-a575-b72b945d6254"
    }

And you get generated lines ready to executed::

    GET /order/status id=dcf43d11-14b4-4737-a575-b72b945d6254

    DELETE /order id=dcf43d11-14b4-4737-a575-b72b945d6254


Special headers
---------------

Timeouts
~~~~~~~~

* ``Vial-Timeout``: sets read timeout (default is 5s).
* ``Vial-Connect-Timeout``: sets connection timeout (default is 30s).

Force ``Host`` header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you need to test production locally, connect to localhost
service and provide production ``Host``. Or test frontend server
behind balancer with different port. You can use ``Vial-Connect`` special
header::

    Host: desktop.production.com
    Vial-Connect: 127.0.0.1:8000
    User-Agent: Mobile User Agent

    GET /  # Response should contain redirect to mobile.production.com

Also you can use explicit schema::

    Vial-Connect: https://127.0.0.1:8443

Client Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Vial-Client-Cert``: path to file with client certificate in PEM format.
  Certificate may include private key.

* ``Vial-Client-Key``: path to file with client private key in PEM format.
  This header is optional if certificate includes key already.

IMPORTANT. Key must be without password protection.

You can get combined certificate by concatenating two PEM files::

    cat client.key client.crt > client.pem


Redirects
~~~~~~~~~

Vial-Http doesn't handle redirects by default. You can control behavior via
``Vial-Redirect`` special header::

    Vial-Redirect: 1
